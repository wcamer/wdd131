                <p id="meDesc">My name is William and I'm from Utah in the United States.  I am a software engineer and have experience in Python, JavaScript, Kotlin, Java, R, Rust, C, C#, and a good handful of other technologies.  I love technology and the possibilities it has to enhance and push forward the world if used correctly.  In my spare time I like to spend time with my family and have a good time.  If I get some time with myself, I like to game.  At the time of writing I'm playing Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.</p>

                <p>Here are some intersting facts about Utah according to "Utah Trivia: fun facts from 125 years" by E. Ashmead.  Utah is home to Lagoon, the oldest amusment park in the American West.  Despite Utah being the 2nd driest state in the U.S., Utah has the best snow on Earth due to the snow being dry.  The world's largest raptor was found in Utah and it is known as "Utahraptor".  Utah is home of the first-ever KFC restaurant (no it wasn't in Kentucky).  Utah has the 3rd most national parks in the United States behind Alaska and California.  </p>
